1) Difference between sql and my sql ?
SQL is a language for interacting with databases.
MySQL is a database system that uses SQL to perform database operations.

2)Unique in MySQL
Ensures data uniqueness in a column or combination of columns.
Allows multiple UNIQUE constraints in a single table.
Allows NULL values (depending on the database system; e.g., MySQL allows multiple NULL values in a unique column, 
while SQL Server and PostgreSQL allow only one NULL).

3)Normalization in SQL
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
It involves dividing tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them to ensure efficient storage
and avoid data anomalies (e.g., update, delete, or insert anomalies).

4)If i have two traits and have same function name in both traits what will be called if i call the function?

PHP will throw a fatal error if two traits have a method with the same name and no resolution is provided.
Use the insteadof operator to specify which method to call.
Use the as keyword to alias one of the methods, allowing access to both.

class MyClass {
    use TraitA, TraitB {
        TraitB::hello insteadof TraitA;
    }
}

$obj = new MyClass();
echo $obj->hello();
